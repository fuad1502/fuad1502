# Hi, I'm Fuad 👋

I am an ex-Hardware Engineer, currently self studying CS to break into the industry. I am interested in Systems Software (OS, Database, Distributed & Embedded Systems). See my guide & progress in [self-study-cs](https://github.com/fuad1502/self-study-cs).

My goal is to consistently contribute to the OSS ecosystem by contributing to public repositories and building my own OSS projects. 

Currently, I am trying to contribute regularly to [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator).

See pinned repositories for currently active projects.

> P.S. My profile image is drawn by my lovely wife ❤️

> See my CV [here](https://github.com/fuad1502/cv). I am currently seeking a job.
