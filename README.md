# Hi, I'm Fuad 👋

About me:
1. I love FOSS 🌲
2. I love to learn 📖
3. I love my wife & two lovely cats 🐱

I contribute to several open source projects:
- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afuad1502)
- [verilator/verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afuad1502)
- [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afuad1502)
- [uuilts/util-linux](https://github.com/uutils/util-linux/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afuad1502)

I also have several open source projects of my own, most notably [oombak](https://github.com/fuad1502/oombak) 🌊

My backround is in EE, but I have decided to switch industry since 2022. So now I am trying make use of my "hybrid" skill set by contributing to open source software tools for hardware development ([CHIPS Alliance](https://www.chipsalliance.org/), [FOSSi](https://fossi-foundation.org/)).

My current interests are: *compilers, OS, embedded and VLSI*

My favorite book is [CSAPP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) 📚

My favorite language is Rust 🦀
