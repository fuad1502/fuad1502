Ex Hardware Engineer, currently self studying CS to break into the industry. Interested in Systems Software 🌐 See my guide (and my personal progress) in [self-study-cs](https://github.com/fuad1502/self-study-cs).

My goal is to consistently contribute to the OSS ecosystem by contributing to public repositories and building my own projects. 

Currently, I am trying to contribute regularly to [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator).

See my pinned repositories for currently active projects.
